Next steps
============

Sparkta is a work in progress, so we still have some nice features to developâ€¦




* Query Services
 Creating a REST services layer in order to query the aggregated data allows us to isolate the final consumer from the specific data storage

* Alarms
 For example, I want to know if we have earned over $3000 in London in the last hour...
 Remember operational intelligence!

* Nice web interface to create and manage policies.

* Stateful operations for real aggregation values for non associative operations.

* Spark jobServer & Yarn, multiple policies in the same spark cluster.

* Full Text Indexes in Cassandra, with Stratio-Cassandra implementation.

* Fault tolerance.

* More and more inputs and outputs.
