e-commerce example
=====================

This example simulates an environment of an e-commerce architecture.
In one hand we have the logs generated by an apache server and in the other the orders requested in the web site.
We'll publish all this events in RabbitMQ (https://www.rabbitmq.com/) and aggregate them with SpaRkTA which will
save the aggregated data in elasticsearch.

Steps
---------------------

* First we need to start the RabbitMQ server and elasticsearch

        sudo service rabbitmq-server start
  
        sudo service elasticsearch start

* Next we run SpaRkTA and send the policy

        cd /opt/sds/sparkta
  
        sudo sh bin/run
  
        curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:9090 --data @examples/ecommerce/ecommerce-policy.json

* And last we need to run the data generators in two different shells 

        cd examples/ecommerce

        mvn -PorderLines clean install benerator:generate
  
        mvn -PvisitLog clean install benerator:generate
